These release notes give an overview of the changes for Release 2020.06 of the Wavefront service. We also just released a new version (6.1) of the Wavefront proxy. See the [Wavefront Proxy Release Notes](proxies_versions.html) for details.

## Role-Based Access Control

Starting with this release, Wavefront has full support for global [role-based access control (RBAC)](users_roles.html).

* Assign **users**  to **groups**.
* Assign **permissions** to **roles**.
* Assign **roles** to **groups** (preferred) or to individual users.

If your environment includes groups that have been assigned permissions, the permissions will be migrated to a role with the same name and that role will be assigned to the group. The Wavefront customers success team will contact all customers that are undergoing that transition.

There are no changes to the access control for individual objects (dashboards and alerts). You can continue to grant access only to individual accounts and to groups.

## Obsolete and Deprecated APIs

The following APIs are now obsolete because permissions are no longer a part of user groups:
```
/api/v2/usergroup/grant/{permission}
/api/v2/usergroup/revoke/{permission}
```

When you search group APIs, you will no longer get a permission as a parameter because permissions are now associated with roles.
```
/api/v2/search/usergroup
/api/v2/search/usergroup/{facet}
/api/v2/search/usergroup/facets
```

The `Users` API is deprecated and will become obsolete in 1 year. Use the `Accounts` API instead.


## Tracing Changes

### Tracing Documentation and README Updates

To make our tracing SDKs more accessible to users, we've revised:
* Updated information about [Wavefront Observability SDKs](wavefront_sdks.html) so it's easier to find the SDK you need.
* Updated several README files in the [Wavefront Github Repository](https://github.com/wavefrontHQ) so it's easier to find and use our SDKs.
This work is ongoing -- Use PRs or email docs@wavefront.com with comments.

### Histogram to Tracing Drilldown

You can drill down to a corresponding trace from a Histogram chart.

### Search for Traces by Trace ID

[Search for a trace using the trace ID](trace_data_query.html#get-started-with-trace-queries). This search does not always return results because Wavefront performs intelligent sampling, and because we keep trace data only for 7 days.

### Span Operators from, followsFrom, childOf

You can use the new operators to find the relationship between spans. See [Use Spans to Examine Applications and Services](spans_function.html#use-spans-to-examine-applications-and-services) for details.

## Other Changes

### Version Info Moves to Gear Icon (About)

<table style="width: 100%;">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="60%">You can now access version information from the gear icon by selecting <strong>About</strong>. In earlier Wavefront releases, this information was at the bottom of each page.
</td>
<td width="40%"><img src="/images/about_menu.png" alt="Get version info from About menu item"/></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


### Users Can't See Alert Events if They Don't Have Access

Wavefront supports [access control](access.html) for alerts. Users with Alerts permissions can revoke access to individual alerts for the Everyone group and give access to individual accounts or groups.

Starting with this release, accounts and groups that don't have access to an alert will no longer see events related to that alert.

### Alert Notification Iterators for Source Tags

Added the following iterators to the [alert notification template](alert_target_customizing.html):
- recoveredHostSourceTags
- newlyFailingHostSourceTags
- inMaintenanceHostSourceTags
- failingHostSourceTags

### AWS Integration Changes

* This release includes **new metrics** for Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) in the AWS integration:

  - aws.rds.allocatedstorage
  - aws.rds.capacity (Aurora only)
  - aws.rds.backtrackconsumedchangerecords (Aurora only)

  This change means that the [list of minimum required permissions](integrations_aws_metrics.html#giving-wavefront-limited-access) now includes `rds:DescribeDBClusters`
