**Note:** Wavefront did not deploy a 2018.34.x release.

## Stacked Columns Stack Type for Stacked Area Chart

For stacked area charts, you can now select a **Stacked Columns** option, which results in a display similar to a bar chart, like the following:

This feature was added to the 2018.32.x release. We're repeating the information here.

## New and Improved Functions
This release includes several new and improved functions.

### New anomalous() and forecast() Functions (Beta)

This release includes two new predictive functions.
**Note:** We are making these functions available as Beta.
* Use the `forecast()` function with the expression as the parameter to perform prediction. Wavefront prepares forecast data for you, so `forecast()` has no additional parameters.
* Use the [`anomalous()` function](ts_anomalous.html) to find anomolous behavior. This function relies on a predictive algorithm rather than just standard deviation checking to find anomalous data points.

### Improvements to top() and bottom() Functions

The `top()`/`topk()` and `bottom()`/`bottomk()` functions now support an optional aggregation and time window parameters.

For example, `topk(10, sum, 2h, rate(ts(requests.failed)))` returns the 10 time series that had the most failures within the last 2 hours.

This change can simplify your query. For example, instead of using an `if()` construct:
```
if(top(10, msum(2h, ts(cpu.usage.idle))), ts(cpu.usage.idle))
```
You can now use:
```
topk(10, sum, 2h, ts(cpu.usage.idle))
```

### Other New and Improved Functions

* New [`ratediff()` function](ts_ratediff.html) that returns the difference between adjacent values in a time series when the counter metric is incrementing. `ratediff()` is similar to the `nonNegativeDerivative()` Graphite function.
* The  [`rate()` function](ts_rate.html) can now be called with a time window parameter, for example, `rate(1m, ts(...))`. This enables the function to estimate initial values after counter resets.
* The [`mpercentile()` function](ts_mpercentile.html) shows significant performance improvements, especially with large moving time windows.
* The [`collect()` function](ts_collect.html) no longer fails when it encounters an expression that does not return data. Going forward, the only requirement is that *at least one* expression returns data.

## Multi-Tenant Single Sign-On

Wavefront now allows you to [request and manage multiple tenants](authentication.html) for your Wavefront instance.
1. You request a multi-tenant setup from Wavefront.
2. Afterwards, tenant administrators can independently invite or remove users.
3. A user who was invited to multiple tenants can switch tenants without logging in again.

The feature is supported for authentication using Okta or Google ID as an identity provider (IP).

## Azure Integration Enhancements

Our Microsoft Azure integrations now retrieve all metrics and dimensions from all services supported by Azure Monitor. Within Wavefront, the dimensions become available as point tags associated with the metrics.

## Performance Improvements

For most environments, we've seen query performance improvements of 25% or more with this release. Improvements are especially noticeable for queries with large aggregations.

## Documentation Changes

Multiple changes, including the addition of a [glossary of Wavefront terms](glossary.html).
