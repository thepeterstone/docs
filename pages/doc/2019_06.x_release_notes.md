## Performance and Stability Enhancements

This release has focused on performance and stability enhancements.

## Documentation Improvement

For each product release, we update the documentation to include information about new features. In addition, we've made several enhancements to the doc set. Here are recent documentation improvements:

* Added section on [videos](videos_quickstart.html), with information about each video, organized by topic area.
* Added section on [distributed tracing](tracing_basics.html)
* Reorganized query language information and added [Query Language Recipes](query_language_recipes.html)
* Simplified section on Charts and Dashboards. We now have an [Examine Data](ui_examine_data.html) page that's suitable for all Wavefront users. Other pages in that section are for users with Dashboard permission, as before.
* Added information on [multi-threshold alerts](alerts.html#creating-a-multi-threshold-alert), including a video. Added [Alert Recipes](alerts_recipes.html)
* Added page on [Wavefront Security](wavefront_security.html)
