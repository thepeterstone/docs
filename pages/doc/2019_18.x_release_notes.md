## Updates to AI Genie Forecasting

Our [AI Genie forecasting engine](ai_genie.html) now uses hypothesis testing and neural networks for prediction. Results are more reliable and visuals are compelling.

## Distributed Tracing No Longer in Beta

For several releases, we've fine-tuned our [distributed tracing functionality](tracing_basics.html) based on internal and customer feedback. The feature has exited Beta and is now considered General Availability.

The new [Tracing Best Practices](tracing_best_practices.html) guidelines help you get optimal results.

## Improved Wavefront Monitoring

This release includes some handy tools for monitoring your Wavefront instance.

### Updates to Spy API
In earlier releases, you can use the `spy` API to examine metric points and IDs. With this release, you can also [examine spans](wavefront_monitoring_spy.html#getting-ingested-spans). Information about this API is now on a [separate doc page](wavefront_monitoring_spy.html).

### New wftop Tool

Wavefront Top (wftop) is an [open source interactive tool](https://github.com/wavefrontHQ/wftop) for examining the shape of the live metric ingestion data and for exploring which metric namespaces were used in the last X days.

The [github page](https://github.com/wavefrontHQ/wftop) has a complete list of features and sample screenshots.

## New and Changed Functions

This release includes new histogram functions and other improvements including a complete set of string functions.

### New Histogram Manipulation Functions

This release includes two functions for making [histogram visualization easier](proxies_histograms.html#histogram-summary-information):
* The `summary()` function returns a summary of a histogram.
* The `alignedSummary()` function returns an aligned summary of a histogram.

For both functions, we return the following information by default:
```
max, P999, P99, P90, P75, avg, median (P50), P25, and min
```
You can specify a list of percentiles instead.

### Forecasting, String Manipulation, and New Parameter for at()

* New forecasting function, [`nnforecast()`](ts_nnforecast.html), which uses hypothesis testing and neural networks for prediction. This function is used by the AI Genie forecasting UI.
* New [string functions](query_language_reference.html#string-functions).
* For the [`at()` function](ts_at.html), new parameter `lookbackDistance`. When you call `at(end)` or `at(now)`, we look back by 1 hour by default. You can now specify a time period instead.
