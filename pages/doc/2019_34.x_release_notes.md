## Query Language Enhancements

* New function [globalFilter()](ts_globalFilter.html). This function is similar to [retainSeries()](ts_retainSeries.html), but filters are pushed all the way into the inner ts()/hs() expressions. That means you can use `globalFilter()` to filter data pre-aggregation.
* New function [join()](query_language_series_joining.html) that is modeled after the SQL JOIN operation. Use the function to see relationships among your time series to build full stack correlations.
* Function [atEpoch()](ts_atEpoch.html) is now documented.

## Tracing Improvements

This release supports several tracing improvements.

### Overview Pages for Application and Service Status

Selecting **Applications > Application Status** now takes you to a searchable page that provides RED metrics for each of your instrumented applications:

Clicking the name of an application now takes you to a searchable page with RED metrics for each of the applicationâ€™s services:

### Cloning a Service Dashboard

You can now clone a service dashboard to:
* Add your own charts.
* Remove, rearrange, or customize the RED metrics charts.

  <!---Use the [ts_countersum](ts_countersum.html) function to display RED metrics.-->

**Note:** For best results, [use the V2 UI version for your dashboard display](users_account_managing.html#switch-between-ui-versions).

## Improvements to v2 Dashboards and Charts

* [Single-stat charts](ui_chart_reference.html#single-stat-chart) are now editable.
  - Customize colors and other aspects of the chart.
  - In the **Drilldown Link** tab, specify a target dashboard and optional values to pass into the dashboard. After you save your single-stat chart, users are directed to the target dashboard when they click the chart.
* We've made usability improvements based on customer feedback.

## Real-Time Alerting Advanced Option

When you create or edit an alert, you can select the **Real-Time Alerting** evaluation strategy. By default, this option is unchecked to avoid spurious alert firings caused by delayed data. See [Limiting the Effects of Data Delays](alerts_delayed_data.html) for background info.
