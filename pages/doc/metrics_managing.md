summary: Understand metrics structure and how to explore metrics in the Metrics Browser

Wavefront provides observability for several different [metric types](metric_types.html) including time series metrics, histograms, and traces/spans. This page looks at the anatomy of a time series metric and shows you how to explore it in the metrics browser.

## Video

In the following video, Wavefront chief architect and co-founder Clement Pang explains why the concept of cardinality is so important for observability, what high cardinality means, and why Wavefront deals so well with high cardinality input.

## Wavefront Time Series Metric Structure

A Wavefront time series has, at a minimum, the metric name, value/timestamp, and source. In many cases, the metric is ingested with additional information represented as tags.

### Simple Time Series

Here's one example that shows the minimum elements of a time series.

![metric, value, timestamp, source](images/metric_anatomy_simple.png)

Each time series is a unique combination of:

* **Metric name**--Describes the metric. There's often a hierarchy of metrics, each with a corresponding time series.
* **Value & Timestamp**--Value at the specified time.
* **Source**--The source of the metric. Host, VM, etc. In contrast to some other observability platforms, this dimension is always part of the metric.

Here's a screenshot of the time series that is shown in the diagram above in a Wavefront chart.

### Time Series with Tags

In most cases, the time series includes one or more tags to allow a more fine-grained analysis. The Wavefront `~sample` data, for example, include point tags for environment and availability zone.

![metric, value, timestamp, source, point tag](images/metric_anatomy_with_tag.png)

Point tags offer a powerful way of labeling data so that you can slice and dice it in almost any way you can imagine. For example, you can use point tags, to label a pointâ€™s datacenter, version, etc. and can then group by datacenter or version.

You use point tags to add extra dimensions to your data, and can then focus your exploration just on that dimension.[Fine Tune Queries with Point Tags](query_language_point_tags.html) explains how to use point tags.

Here's a screenshot of the time series that includes point tags in a Wavefront chart.

### How Filtering with Tags Improves Usability

How the point tag filters are useful becomes obvious when the `source=` filter is removed. The result of all time series for `~sample.disk.space.used` is visually confusing.

When you add filters for `env` and `az`, the information makes sense.

## Metrics Browser

Select **Browse > Metrics** to display the Metrics Browser. Use the Metrics Browser to find metrics that sent at least one data point within the last four weeks.

To make search easier, you can
* Drill down and go up the hierarchy.
* Filter by source.
* Hide and redisplay metrics or groups of metrics.

{% include tip.html content="If you select **Browse > Delta Counters** you can use the same browser to examine [delta counters](delta_counters.html). The process is exactly the same." %}

### Examine Metrics

<table style="width: 100%;">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="60%">
<strong>To examine metrics</strong>
<ol>
<li>Select <strong>Browse > Metrics</strong></li>
<li>Select folder icons to drill down to individual metrics.</li>
<li>With a metric selectd, click <strong>Info</strong> to show sources and point tags for that metric.</li>
<li>Click the metric name to show a chart with that metric.</li>
</ol></td>
<td width="40%"><img src="/images/browse_metrics.png" alt="browse metrics"></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


## Hide and Redisplay Metrics

You can manually hide metrics from the Metrics browser. Those metrics become unavailable from the auto-complete menu as well. Manually hiding metrics does not permanently delete a metric or metric namespace.

{% include shared/permissions.html entity="metrics" entitymgmt="Metric" %}

{% include tip.html content="While hidden metrics are removed from the autocomplete dropdown, those metrics can still be used in a query as long as data points exist." %}

<table style="width: 100%;">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="60%">
<strong>To hide one or more metrics:</strong>
<ol>
<li>Select <strong>Browse > Metrics</strong></li>
<li>Click the <strong>Manage Hidden Metrics</strong> button</li>
<li>In the dialog type a complete metrics name (e.g. <code>requests.latency</code>) or a metric prefix (e.g. <code>requests.</code>, <code>cpu.loadavg.</code>).
<ul>
<li>This field does not support auto-complete, so you have to type the entire metric name or metric prefix.</li>
<li>The text is case sensitive.</li>
<li>Wildcards are not supported. The star <code>*</code> character is considered part of the text string.</li>

</ul></li>
<li>Press Enter to add the metric(s) to the list and click <strong>Save</strong>.</li>
</ol> </td>
<td width="40%"><img src="/images/hide_metrics.png" alt="hide metrics"></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<table style="width: 100%;">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="60%">
<strong>To view hidden metrics:</strong>
<ol>
<li>Select <strong>Browse > Metrics</strong></li>
<li>Click the <strong>Manage Hidden Metrics</strong> button.</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Unhide</strong> button to the right of the metric or metric prefix to unhide and click <strong>Save</strong>.</li>
</ol>
The selected metrics and metric prefixes appear again as long as they have had at least 1 reported data value in the last 4 weeks. Otherwise, these metric/metric prefixes are considered obsolete metrics and Wavefront hides them. You can show obsolete metrics for individual charts or alerts. </td>
