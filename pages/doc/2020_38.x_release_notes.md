These release notes give an overview of the changes for Release 2020-38.x of the Wavefront service.

## Metrics Security




## Delta Counters

### Wavefront Spy

This release includes support for [Wavefront Spy for delta counters](wavefront_monitoring_spy.html#get-ingested-delta-counters-with-spy). We do not support exploration of delta counters in Wavefront Top yet.

### UI Support for Delta Counters

Additional support for delta counters in the Wavefront UI:
<table style="width: 100%;">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>To <strong>query</strong> delta counter metrics, you can now select <strong>Delta Counters</strong> in Chart Builder.</td>
<td><img src="/images/v2_add_metric.png" alt="Chart Builder with delta counters selected"/> </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="60%">To <strong>examine all delta counters</strong> in your environment, select <strong>Browse &gt; Delta Counters</strong>. The process is the same as examining metrics in the <a href="metrics_managing.html#metrics-browser"> Metrics Browser</a>.
</td>
<td width="40%"><img src="/images/delta_counters_browse.png" alt="Screenshot showing Browse > Delta Counters"/></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

## URL Unfurler for Slack

<table style="width: 100%;">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>You can now add the Wavefront application to Slack. Afterwards, users who paste a link to a Wavefront instance are prompted whether they want to unfurl the link. An example is in the right column. </td>
<td><img src="/images/unfurled_chart_doc.png" alt="Wavefront chart inside Slack"/> </td>
</tr>


## Miscellaneous Improvements

We made several other improvements to product and documentation:

* You can now [conditionalize dashboard sections](ui_dashboards.html#advanced-edit-dashboard-json). This functionality is supported only through the dashboard JSON editor.
* Wavefront created [their own Terraform provider]XX . The provider is available through the Terraform integration and on Github.
