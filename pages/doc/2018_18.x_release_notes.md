2018-18.x release highlights:
* Miscellaneous improvements
* Documentation improvements


## Miscellaneous Improvements
* For alert targets of type `webhook`, custom header maximum size  has been increased to 2048.
* The `align()` function supports an additional parameter, `bw`, which allows you to use bucket window time.

## Documentation Improvements
* The documentation now includes [reference pages](https://docs.wavefront.com/label_reference%20page.html) for many but not all query language functions. The pages are also linked from the [Query Language Reference](http://docs.wavefront.com/query_language_reference.html). We plan on incrementally improving the pages, and on creating a page for each function.
* The documentation now includes the Overview and Setup information that is included with our in-product integrations in an [integrations list](http://docs.wavefront.com/label_integrations%20list.html)
