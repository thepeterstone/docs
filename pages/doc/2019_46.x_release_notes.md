## Dashboard Improvements (v2)

Our v2 UI has several dashboard improvements in this release. If your cluster has v2 enabled, you can switch UI versions [from the gear icon](users_account_managing.html#switch-between-ui-versions).

### Create Dashboard from Template

<table style="width: 100%;">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<p>You can now create a dashboard from a template. You'll be prompted to select an integration that has data flowing, then to select the dashboard and the charts on that dashboard.</p></td>
<td width="60%"><img src="/images/v2_create_dashboard_template.png" alt="Create a dashboard from a template"/></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Undo in Dashboard Edit Mode

<table style="width: 100%;">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<p>With your dashboard in Edit mode, you can now undo and redo changes to the dashboard. </p></td>
<td width="60%"><img src="/images/v2_undo.png" alt="Undo and redo icons"/></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Global Filters in Dashboards

<table style="width: 100%;">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="40%"><a href="ui_examine_data.html#filter-with-global-filters-or-dashboard-variables"> Global filters</a> allow any user to:
<ol>
<li>Specify a key-value pair as a filter for the dashboard. <br><br>All filters show up to the right of any dashboard variables</li> <li>Remove the filter by clicking the <strong>X</strong>. </li></ol></td>
<td width="60%"><img src="/images/global_filters.png" alt="Global filter set and see"/></td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Drilldown Link Option for All Chart Types

<table style="width: 100%;">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="40%">The <a href="ui_charts_faq.html#how-do-drilldown-links-work"> drilldown link option</a> is now available for all chart types.

<ul><li>
Any user who clicks on single-stat, topk, or node map chart is redirected to a specified target dashboard.</li>
<li>For other chart types, users can click the ellipsis icon in the top right and select the target dashboard. </li></ul></td>
<td width="60%"><img src="/images/drilldown_ellipsis.png" alt="Drilldown ellipsis"/></td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

You can optionally pass in a value from the origin chart during drilldown link creation.

### Raw Value Option for Single Stat Charts

<table style="width: 100%;">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="40%">Starting with this release, you can check a <strong>Display Raw Value</strong> option to show the raw value. The screenshot on the right shows an example. <br><br>
For new Single Stat charts, the option is checked by default.
</td>
<td width="60%">
<img src="/images/raw_value_checked.png" alt="Single stat chart with Raw Value checked"/></td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

## Topk and Node Map Charts (v2)

This release supports full edit functionality for [**topk charts**](ui_chart_reference.html#topk-chart) and [**node map charts**](ui_chart_reference.html#node-map-chart). These chart types were available only as read-only charts. They now support color mapping and drilldown links.

<table style="width: 100%;">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
A <strong>topk chart</strong> shows the most critical time series (8 by default) as horizontal bars.
<ul>
<li>Add a color mapping to highlight values</li>
<li>Specify the number of bars and other details such as the bar label, bar header, etc.</li>
<li>Specify a drilldown link that directs users to a different dashboard when they click on a bar.</li></ul></td>
<td width="60%"><img src="images/topk.png" alt="topk chart"/></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
A <strong>node map</strong> shows colored 3-D cubes ordered from highest to lowest based on source values.
<ul>
<li>When a user clicks a node, a small popup of the corresponding metric for that source results.</li>
<li>If a drilldown link is specified, users are directed to a different dashboard when they click a node.</li>
<li>An animation unfurls the node map when the page refreshes. </li></ul></td>
<td width="60%"><img src="images/node_map.png" alt="node map chart"/></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

## Query Language Changes

* We now allow lower case or all caps for the strings `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT` for better legibility of long combinations of metrics.
* The [`timespan() event management function`](event_timespan.html) now supports adding tags with a time expression. Before, only Epoch time was supported.

## New Tracing and Histogram Features

Several new features make working with tracing and histograms easier.

### Java Tracing Agent

The new [Wavefront Java Tracing Agent](https://github.com/wavefrontHQ/wavefront-opentracing-bundle-java) has been available in Github for 1+ month. See [this blog post](https://www.wavefront.com/wavefront-tracing-agent-for-java/) for details.

### Drilldown from the Service Dashboard to the Tracing Browser

From this release onwards, you can directly navigate to tracing information from the service dashboard. See [Navigate to the Tracing Browser from the Service Dashboard](tracing_ui_overview.html#Tracesbrowser).

### Spy for Histograms

You can now [retrieve ingested histograms with Spy](wavefront_monitoring_spy.html#get-ingested-histograms-with-spy) to examine your histogram data.

## Documentation Changes and New Videos

* Starting with this release, v2 dashboards and charts are becoming the default. For pages where the differences between the v1 UI and the v2 UI are significant, you can click **v1 Doc** to go to the corresponding v1 documentation.

   Here's an example screenshot.
