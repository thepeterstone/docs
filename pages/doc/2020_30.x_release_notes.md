These release notes give an overview of the changes for Release 2020-30.x of the Wavefront service.

## OpenTelemetry Support in Wavefront

OpenTracing and OpenCensus have merged to form OpenTelemetry. You can use OpenTelemetry to send metrics or traces to Wavefront using the Prometheus, Jaeger, or Zipkin integration. See [OpenTelemetry](opentelemetry.html) for details.

## Tracing Features

### Aggregated RED Metrics

To make RED metric querying faster, Wavefront introduced [pre-aggregated RED metrics](/trace_data_details.html#aggregated-red-metrics).  Querying and aggregating service-level RED metrics can be slow due to high cardinality from operation tags, source tags, and custom tags.

### RED Metrics for Tracing Traffic

Traffic shows how applications and services interact with each other. You can visualize traffic data in charts using tracing traffic derived metrics. See [RED Metrics for Tracing Traffic](trace_data_details.html#red-metrics-for-tracing-traffic) for details.

### Live View, External Services and Other UI Improvements

This release includes several UI improvements.

* Use [**Map View Settings**](/tracing_ui_overview.html#application-map-beta) to toggle these features:
  - Show/hide **external** applications or services, such as Amazon services or database services that your application communicates with. Group those external services.
  - Show/hide **isolated services**, which are services that are not used by any other services or applications.
  - Show/hide service labels.
* Turn on Live View for the application map below the task bar. The refresh rate for Live View is 5 minutes.

## Alert Improvements and convertWhiteSpace Parameter

* Alert notifications to Slack are now more succinct.
* New [`convertWhiteSpace` utility parameter](alert_target_customizing.html#utility-functions-for-readability) to convert characters that cause problems in a JSON file (`\t` `\n` `\x0B` `\f` `\r` etc.) to white space.

## Miscellaneous Improvements

We made the following improvements to the Wavefront service.

* It's now possible to specify threshold-based coloring for a heatmap chart.
* The [`missing`](ts_missing.html) function now returns 0 or 1.


In Wavefront Proxy 9.0, released recently, the following properties were renamed:

* `*blackListRegex` is now `*block`
* `*whiteListRegex` is now `*allow`
