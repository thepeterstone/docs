## Access Control for Alerts

We now support fine-grained access control over alerts, just we already do for dashboards:

* Add and remove access to one or more individual alerts from the Alerts browser.
* Edit an alert and use the Share icon to give access to other users and groups.
* When you change the [Security system preference](access.html#changing-the-access-control-security-preference), you now affect both dashboards and alerts.
* [Super Admin users](users_roles.html#who-is-the-super-admin-user) control access to any alert. They can also restore orphan alerts if the Everyone group was removed.
* The [Everyone group](users_roles.html#whats-the-everyone-group) is assigned access to each alert by default. You can see that for each dashboard by selecting **Access** from the vertical dots icon.
